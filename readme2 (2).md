## Overview

**Project Title**: Language Vocab Learner

**Project Description**: A mobile app where users can choose a language in which to learn vocabulary. After a language is chosen, they will be taken to a separate page with the chosen language's vocab words.  

**Project Goals**: Allow user input by clicking a language. Create a separate screen to display vocabulary words. Create an overall good user experience!

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Ensure you have node.js downloaded. 
2. Create an expo, either new or the beginning template provided by React Native. 
3. Make changes to the beginning template in the tsx files or start over using "npm run reset-project".

Instructions for using the software:

1. Open the app
2. Choose a language to learn 
3. View the vocabulary words on the separate screen
4. Choose to go back to the main menu using the back button
5. Pick another language to learn if desired

## Development Environment

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] More vocab languages, hopefully from an API so I don't have to create the files with the information manually.
* [ ] Make the app a little prettier overall and less bland.
* [ ] Make a way to track progress with learning and make flashcards
